Raindrops Game Project
======================

This game will have an array of falling raindrops that will move down the screen one at a time. There will also be a catcher that will follow the mouse, and the game will check to see if the raindrop touches the catcher. If the raindrop touches the catcher, the score will increase and the raindrop that was touching the catcher will disappear. After a certain amount of time, a new raindrop will appear. There may be something added to that if the raindrop touches the ground, the game will be over.


Steps of Making the Game
========================

*Create a raindrop (by creating a raindrop Class)
*Create a catcher (by creating a catcher Class)
*The catcher will follow the mouse.
*If the catcher intersects a raindrop, this raindrop is caught.
*If a raindrop is caught, the raindrop will go away.
*If a raindrop is caught, the score of the game will be increased (the score should be displayed on the screen somewhere)
